The process of OTP Verification entails confirming a user's authenticity through the transmission of an exclusive password, ensuring their validation prior to finalizing registration or payment procedures. Typically, an OTP is received for various instances, such as initiating online transactions, recovering forgotten passwords, or establishing accounts on digital platforms. Thus, the fundamental objective behind an OTP revolves around verifying a user's identity via the dissemination of a one-of-a-kind password.
We can create an application for the task of OTP verification using Python.
